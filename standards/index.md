# AI Standards

## [Clarity over confusion](/standards/clarity.md)
AI systems must communicate their limits and capabilities plainly. Users deserve to understand exactly what an AI system can and cannot do, avoiding misleading claims or hidden limitations that could lead to misuse or disappointment.

## [Reliability over chance](/standards/reliability.md)
Tools must perform consistently, not just occasionally. AI systems should deliver predictable, dependable results that users can count on for critical decisions and everyday tasks, rather than being unreliable or erratic.

## [Transparency over obscurity](/standards/transparency.md)
Users should understand what drives outcomes, not face a black box. The decision-making processes, data sources, and reasoning behind AI outputs must be explainable and accessible to those who need to understand them.

## [Accountability over excuses](/standards/accountability.md)
When AI fails, the responsibility must be traceable. Clear lines of accountability must exist so that when AI systems make errors or cause harm, the responsible parties can be identified and held accountable.

## [Human-first design](/standards/human-first.md)
Standards serve people, not machines. All AI standards and systems should prioritize human welfare, dignity, and benefit, ensuring that technology enhances rather than diminishes human capabilities and well-being.
