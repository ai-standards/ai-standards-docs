# AI Standards

## [Communicate Clearly](/standards/clarity.md)
AI systems must state their limits and capabilities plainly. Users deserve to understand what the system can and cannot do, avoiding misleading claims or hidden limitations.

## [Deliver Reliably](/standards/reliability.md)
AI tools should perform consistently and predictably. People must be able to depend on them for both everyday tasks and critical decisions.

## [Explain Transparently](/standards/transparency.md)
The reasoning, data, and processes behind AI outputs must be open and accessible, so users are not left facing a black box.

## [Accept Accountability](/standards/accountability.md)
When AI fails, responsibility must be traceable. Clear accountability ensures errors and harms are owned, addressed, and not hidden behind excuses.

## [Prioritize Humans](/standards/human-first.md)
AI should always serve people—enhancing dignity, capability, and well-being—rather than diminishing them.

## [Protect Safety](/standards/safety.md)
AI must safeguard users and society from harm. Systems should prevent dangerous or abusive outputs, minimize bias, and include robust safeguards against misuse.
