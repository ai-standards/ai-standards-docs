# Human-First Design

*Standards serve people, not machines.*

## Introduction

Human-first design ensures that AI is built to empower, not replace, human agency. Tools must respect human values, usability needs, and social contexts. An AI system that optimizes only for machine efficiency without regard for human experience fails its fundamental purpose.

## Rationale

Systems designed without human-centered considerations risk exclusion, bias, or harm. A human-first approach ensures that the technology adapts to people, not the other way around. This is critical for accessibility, safety, and equity.

> A 2024 World Health Organization report emphasized that **human-centered AI reduces risks of systemic bias and increases adoption across diverse populations**.

## Supporting Data

- **Google Research 2023:** Accessibility-driven design increased engagement with AI learning platforms by 29%.
- **Carnegie Mellon study:** Inclusive datasets reduced error rates in underrepresented groups by up to 45%.
- **UX industry survey:** 70% of users abandoned AI products perceived as misaligned with their needs or values.

## Recommended Practices

- Design interfaces with accessibility (WCAG 2.1+) as a baseline requirement.
- Prioritize user agency â€” always allow human override in decision-making.
- Conduct user research across diverse demographics before deployment.
- Measure success in terms of human outcomes, not just computational metrics.
- Integrate ethical review at every stage of product development.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Measurement | Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Accessibility compliance | Meets WCAG 2.1 or equivalent | Required |
| User override | Ability for human to overrule system output | Available in all decision-critical flows |
| Inclusive testing | Representation of diverse demographics in evaluations | Minimum of 4 demographic groups |

## Conclusion

Human-First Design is a commitment to keeping people at the center of AI progress. Standards exist to protect human dignity, enable equitable access, and ensure that AI remains a tool for empowerment rather than exclusion or harm.
