# Safety over Risk
AI must safeguard users and society from harm.

## Introduction
Safety ensures that AI systems are designed, tested, and deployed with protections against harmful or abusive outcomes. From preventing dangerous instructions to reducing bias and misinformation, safety must be built in from the beginning—not bolted on after harm occurs. A culture of safety builds public trust and protects human well-being.

## Rationale
Without robust safety measures, AI systems can unintentionally generate harmful content, reinforce discrimination, or encourage risky behavior. In high-stakes contexts like healthcare, education, or mental health, unsafe AI can cause irreversible damage. Standards must ensure AI protects people even under failure or stress.

A 2023 Stanford Human-Centered AI report identified “safety risks” as the leading factor limiting public adoption of generative AI tools.

## Supporting Data
- **WHO 2024**: Unsafe AI deployments in healthcare led to diagnostic error rates 27% higher in systems without formal safety guardrails.  
- **MIT study 2023**: Red-teaming reduced harmful outputs in LLMs by 62% on average.  
- **OECD survey 2024**: 74% of organizations cited “safety concerns” as the main barrier to scaling AI across critical services.  

## Recommended Practices
- Integrate structured red-team testing before deployment.  
- Establish human-in-the-loop reviews for sensitive or high-risk decisions.  
- Implement content filters and guardrails against known unsafe outputs (self-harm, violence, illegal activity).  
- Monitor for emergent risks continuously post-deployment.  
- Train staff and users on safe use practices and escalation procedures.  

## Evaluation Criteria
| Criterion              | Measurement                           | Threshold             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Red-team testing       | Documented pre-deployment exercises   | Required              |
| Human oversight        | Human review of critical AI outcomes  | 100% of high-risk use |
| Safety incidents       | Logged, tracked, and resolved         | Within 30 days        |
| Continuous monitoring  | Ongoing model risk assessments        | Quarterly minimum     |

## Conclusion
Safety over Risk ensures that AI systems actively protect against harm rather than relying on good intentions. By embedding safety into design, deployment, and governance, organizations create technologies that people can trust with their well-being and livelihoods.
