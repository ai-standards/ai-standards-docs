# Reliability over Chance

*Tools must perform consistently, not just occasionally.*

## Introduction

Reliability is the difference between a novelty and a tool. An AI system that performs brilliantly in one instance but fails unpredictably in another cannot be trusted in professional or critical contexts. Reliability transforms AI from a curiosity into a dependable instrument.

## Rationale

Unreliable AI systems cause errors, increase operational costs, and erode user trust. For industries like healthcare, aviation, and legal services, even small inconsistencies can create disproportionate risks. Establishing reliability as a standard ensures AI can be safely embedded into workflows.

> A 2024 McKinsey report found that **74% of organizations paused AI rollouts after discovering inconsistent outputs across identical test cases**.

## Supporting Data

- **NIST 2023 study:** Variance in outputs across identical prompts exceeded 25% in leading LLMs without structured controls.
- **Microsoft reliability pilot:** Adding deterministic evaluation layers reduced error variance by 40%.
- **Harvard Law research:** Inconsistent AI legal advice increased malpractice risk in simulations by 2.3Ã—.

## Recommended Practices

- Use deterministic inference where feasible (e.g., fixed seeds, controlled temperature settings).
- Implement regression testing to detect drift in outputs over time.
- Publish consistency metrics alongside accuracy metrics.
- Provide clear fallback mechanisms when reliability cannot be guaranteed.
- Continuously monitor outputs against benchmark datasets.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Measurement | Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Consistency rate | Variance in identical prompts across runs | <5% variation |
| Regression testing | Presence of automated reliability tests | Required |
| Fallback strategy | Documented user path when system fails | Available in all critical flows |

## Conclusion

Reliability is not optional. AI tools that cannot be trusted to deliver consistent results should not be deployed in contexts where decisions, safety, or livelihoods are at stake. This standard demands consistency as the bedrock of AI adoption.
