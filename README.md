# AI Standards Documentation

> **Building trustworthy AI through clear, measurable standards**

The AI Standards Foundation exists to establish a clear baseline of trustworthiness, usability, and accountability for AI systems. These are not aspirational goals—they are the minimum requirements for AI to serve people safely and effectively.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We hold that every AI system must meet a clear baseline of trustworthiness, usability, and accountability. Our standards ensure AI serves people, not the other way around.

## 📋 Core Standards

Our five foundational principles form the backbone of trustworthy AI:

- **[Clarity over Confusion](/docs/standards/clarity.md)** — AI systems must communicate their limits and capabilities plainly
- **[Reliability over Chance](/docs/standards/reliability.md)** — Tools must perform consistently, not just occasionally  
- **[Transparency over Obscurity](/docs/standards/transparency.md)** — Users should understand what drives outcomes, not face a black box
- **[Accountability over Excuses](/docs/standards/accountability.md)** — When AI fails, the responsibility must be traceable
- **[Human-First Design](/docs/standards/human-first.md)** — Standards serve people, not machines
