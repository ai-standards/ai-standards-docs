# AI Standards Documentation

> **Building trustworthy AI through clear, measurable standards**

The AI Standards Foundation exists to establish a clear baseline of trustworthiness, usability, and accountability for AI systems. These are not aspirational goals—they are the minimum requirements for AI to serve people safely and effectively.

## Our Mission

We hold that every AI system must meet a clear baseline of trustworthiness, usability, and accountability. Our standards ensure AI serves people, not the other way around.

## Core Standards

Our five foundational principles form the backbone of trustworthy AI:

- **[Clarity over Confusion](/standards/clarity.md)** — AI systems must communicate their limits and capabilities plainly
- **[Reliability over Chance](/standards/reliability.md)** — Tools must perform consistently, not just occasionally  
- **[Transparency over Obscurity](/standards/transparency.md)** — Users should understand what drives outcomes, not face a black box
- **[Accountability over Excuses](/standards/accountability.md)** — When AI fails, the responsibility must be traceable
- **[Human-First Design](/standards/human-first.md)** — Standards serve people, not machines

2. Assess your current AI systems against our standards
3. Create implementation plans for gaps
4. Establish governance structures for ongoing compliance

### For Researchers & Policymakers
1. Explore the evidence base supporting each standard
2. Review evaluation criteria and measurement approaches
3. Consider how standards apply to your domain
4. Contribute research and case studies
