# The AI Standards Manifesto

AI is rapidly reshaping how we work, create, and decide. Yet too often, the tools we depend on fall short—lacking usability, transparency, or reliability. What would be unacceptable in any other professional field is still tolerated in AI.

**The AI Standards Foundation** exists to change that.

We hold that every AI system must meet a clear baseline of trustworthiness, usability, and accountability. These are not aspirational goals—they are the minimum requirements for AI to serve people safely and effectively.

This manifesto sets out the principles we consider non-negotiable:

- **[Clarity over confusion](/standards/clarity)** — AI systems must communicate their limits and capabilities plainly.  
- **[Reliability over chance](/standards/reliability)** — Tools must perform consistently, not just occasionally.  
- **[Transparency over obscurity](/standards/transparency)** — Users should understand what drives outcomes, not face a black box.  
- **[Accountability over excuses](/standards/accountability)** — When AI fails, the responsibility must be traceable.  
- **[Human-first design](/standards/human-first)** — Standards serve people, not machines.

These principles are our foundation. They will evolve as the field evolves—but they will not weaken.

The AI Standards Foundation is independent, open, and uncompromising in pursuit of these values. Its outputs—tests, benchmarks, and specifications—are shared openly for adoption and critique. The work speaks louder than any individual voice.
